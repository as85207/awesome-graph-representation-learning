# Background
> The field of graph representation learning has grown at an incredible (and sometimes unwieldy) pace over the past seven years, transforming from a small subset of researchers working on a relatively niche topic to one of the fastest growing sub-areas of deep learning.  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; - - William L. Hamilton

Graph representation learning (GRL) have recently become increasingly popular due to their ability to model *relationships* or *interactions* of complex systems. However GRL is still a nascent field in the Machine Learning community. Rather than providing overwhelming amount of papers, the goal of this repository is to provide a *curated list* of awesome GRL papers that we have read, as well as some intriguing blog posts and talks.
